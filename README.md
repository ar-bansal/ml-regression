# ml-regression
Statistical analysis of linear regression models for increased interpretability. 

This repo was created to learn about the statistical analysis of linear regression models. 

Creating models using sklearn is a straightforward task that requires less than 10 lines of code. However, pushing the accuracy of the model calls for a deeper understanding of probability and statistics, and how they need to be applied to regression. 

This repo uses `statsmodels` for fitting the model, and then subsequently analysing the fit, exploring different stats of the fitted models, and then iteratively trying to improve the fit.
